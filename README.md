# Apeirophobia

Apeirophobia is a dark-themed 3D puzzle platformer built in Unity.
The entire game takes place inside the mind of a child undergoing hypnosis, diving into fractured memories and symbolic spaces to confront and heal buried trauma.

This project was created as an end-of-studies game, exploring atmosphere, emotion, and surreal storytelling.

## About the Game

You navigate shifting dream-like environments filled with puzzles, platforming challenges, and abstract representations of fear.
The mood leans into psychological tension rather than jump scares, using lighting, space, and sound design to convey unease and introspection.

**Themes include:**

* Trauma and recovery
* Memory and perception
* Navigating fear through symbolism

---

## Gameplay

Apeirophobia blends:

* 3D platforming
* Environmental puzzles
* Narrative symbolism
* Surreal level transitions inside the mind

As you progress, environments become more distorted and metaphorical, representing deeper layers of subconscious conflict.
